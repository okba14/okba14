## Hi there 👋 I'm Oqba

<!--
**okba14/okba14** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->

🔭 I’m currently working on:
- 🔧 [GuiarStr](https://github.com/okba14/guiarstr) – a lightweight C string library focused on performance and portability.
- 🔒 Custom tools for memory inspection and vulnerability detection (low-level dev).
- 📜 Writing about smart contract vulnerabilities and low-level security flaws.

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Advanced exploitation techniques (heap, ROP, and binary fuzzing).
- Smart contract security auditing and formal verification.
- Optimizing Solidity gas usage and EVM bytecode.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Open-source blockchain security tools.
- Educational projects for teaching low-level programming.
- CTF challenges (crypto, reverse engineering, pwn).

🤔 I’m looking for help with:
- Connecting with researchers in smart contract verification.
- Contributing to blockchain-based privacy-preserving protocols.

💬 Ask me about:
- C programming, Assembly, memory manipulation.
- Binary exploitation and bug bounty methodology.
- Solidity smart contract auditing.
